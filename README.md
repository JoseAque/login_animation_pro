## 📖 Project Description
This project showcases an **animated login screen** using Flutter with **Rive** integration for interactive animations. The screen is designed to enhance the user experience in a fun and intuitive way.  

The character **Teddy** reacts to user actions:  
- 👀 Follows the **username** text field with its eyes.  
- 🙈 Covers its eyes when typing the **password**.  
- 😲 Shows surprise if the password is incorrect. 
- 😄 Shows happiness if the password is correct. 

> Note: This project **does not include character creation or Rive animation design**, but demonstrates integration of an existing example and implementation of interactive logic.  
> You can find and download the animation used from Rive: [Login Machine Rive](https://rive.app/marketplace/3645-7621-remix-of-login-machine/)  

### ℹ️ What is Rive?
Rive is a tool that allows you to create **interactive vector animations** for apps, games, and websites. It enables developers to integrate dynamic, responsive animations without manually coding every frame.  

### ℹ️ What is a State Machine in Rive?
A **State Machine** is a system within Rive that controls animation logic based on user input or events. You can define **states** (like idle, hands-up, success) and **transitions** between them triggered by variables such as booleans, numbers, or triggers. This allows animations to **react dynamically** to interactions in your app.
